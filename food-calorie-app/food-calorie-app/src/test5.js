          <p>Having regular eye tests means you can keep on top of your prescription and eye health. How often you should have your eyes checked will depend on your eye health. The NHS recommend adults over 16 have an eye test every two years. However, your optician will be able to let you know how often is best for you.If youâ€™re experiencing recent changes to your vision, book an appointment with your closest Vision Express optician.</p>

          <h2>What can eye test detect?</h2>
          <p>An eye test can detect underlying health problems that you aren't aware of, such as Diabetes, High Blood Pressure, some brain tumours, and multiple sclerosis. The eye test will detect if your vision can be improved. You may just be used to seeing less clearly so don't realise it can be improved upon.</p>
